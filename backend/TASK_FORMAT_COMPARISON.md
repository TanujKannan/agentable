# Task Format Enhancement

This document shows the improvement in task generation format to match the detailed style of your `tasks.yaml` configuration.

## ❌ **Before Enhancement (Simple Tasks)**

```json
{
  "id": "research_task",
  "name": "research_task", 
  "description": "Research AI trends",
  "expected_output": "A list of trends",
  "assigned_agent": "researcher",
  "dependencies": [],
  "output_file": null
}
```

## ✅ **After Enhancement (Elaborate Tasks)**

```json
{
  "id": "comprehensive_research_task",
  "name": "detailed_ai_trends_research",
  "description": "Conduct a thorough research about AI trends and developments in 2024. Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given the current year is 2024. Focus on recent developments, key trends, and significant breakthroughs. Analyze multiple reliable sources and cross-reference information for accuracy. Pay special attention to emerging technologies, market adoption rates, and industry impact.",
  "expected_output": "A comprehensive list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about AI trends and developments in 2024. Each bullet point should include specific details, sources, and dates where applicable. Organize the information from most important to least important, highlighting breakthrough technologies and market implications.",
  "assigned_agent": "researcher", 
  "dependencies": [],
  "output_file": "ai_trends_research_2024.md"
}
```

## 🎯 **Key Improvements**

### **1. Detailed Descriptions**
- **Before**: "Research AI trends" (3 words)
- **After**: Multi-sentence descriptions with specific instructions, context, and methodology (50+ words)

### **2. Specific Expected Outputs** 
- **Before**: "A list of trends" (4 words)
- **After**: Detailed specifications including format, structure, length, and quality requirements (30+ words)

### **3. Variable Integration**
- Uses variables like `{topic}`, `{current_year}`, `{user_query}` 
- Automatically substituted with actual values during processing
- Enables dynamic, context-aware task descriptions

### **4. Format Requirements**
- Specifies output format (markdown, bullet points, sections)
- Includes length requirements (10 bullet points, 1500 words, etc.)
- Details structure and organization requirements

### **5. Output Files**
- Specific output file names for better organization
- Files named meaningfully based on task content
- Enables better result tracking and management

## 📋 **Task Format Template**

The enhanced system now follows this template, matching your `tasks.yaml` style:

```yaml
task_name:
  description: >
    [Multi-sentence detailed description]
    [Specific instructions and context]
    [Methodology and approach guidance]
    [Quality and accuracy requirements]
  expected_output: >
    [Detailed output specification]
    [Format requirements and structure]
    [Length and organization details]
    [Quality standards and criteria]
  agent: [assigned_agent_name]
  dependencies: [list_of_prerequisite_tasks]
  output_file: meaningful_filename.ext
```

## 🔄 **Examples by Task Type**

### **Research Tasks**
```
Description: "Conduct thorough research about {topic}. Focus on recent developments, 
key trends, and significant breakthroughs. Analyze multiple reliable sources and 
cross-reference information for accuracy..."

Expected Output: "A comprehensive list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant 
information about {topic}. Each bullet point should include specific details, 
sources, and dates where applicable..."
```

### **Analysis Tasks**  
```
Description: "Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section 
for a report. Analyze patterns, draw insights, and provide actionable recommendations 
based on the research findings..."

Expected Output: "A fully fledged report with the main topics, each with a full 
section of information. Formatted as markdown without '```'. Include executive 
summary, detailed analysis, and recommendations..."
```

### **Writing Tasks**
```
Description: "Create compelling content based on the research and analysis provided. 
Ensure the writing is engaging, well-structured, and tailored to the target audience. 
Include relevant examples and actionable insights..."

Expected Output: "A well-structured document of 1500-2000 words with clear headings, 
subheadings, and bullet points where appropriate. Format as professional markdown 
without code blocks..."
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Enhancement**

Run the test to see the improved task format:

```bash
cd backend
python test_enhanced_system.py
```

You'll now see output like:
```
Task: detailed_research_task
  Description preview: Conduct a thorough research about Research AI trends in 2024 and create a comprehensive...
  Expected output preview: A comprehensive list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about...
  ✅ Elaborate format: True
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

1. **Better Agent Performance**: More detailed instructions lead to better results
2. **Consistent Quality**: Standardized format ensures consistent output quality  
3. **Clear Expectations**: Agents know exactly what to produce and how
4. **Professional Output**: Results match professional documentation standards
5. **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and modify task requirements

The enhanced task generation now produces professional, detailed task specifications that match the quality and style of your existing `tasks.yaml` configuration!
